# BBCAutoPatcher
Running BBCAutoPatcher.bat generates an auto patch for the Morrowind mod Better Balanced Combat.

For now the auto patch just applies NPC/Creature effects but if everything on the to-do list gets finished then it could replace hand made patches.

Feel free to commit.

# To-do
Copy OpenMW load order to original Morrowind on yes/no prompt.

Convert Fortify Attack and Fortify/Drain/Restore/Damage/Absorb Weapon Skill effects to Fortify/Drain/Restore/Damage/Absorb Attribute Strength effects with magnitude divided by 10 (minimum of 1 magnitude, round up).

Convert Sanctuary effects to Fortify Skill Block.

Make blind effects only max magnitude and decrease duration by half.

Convert blind ingredient effects to Drain Block.
