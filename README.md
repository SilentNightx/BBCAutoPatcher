# BBCAutoPatcher
Running BBCAutoPatcher.bat generates an auto patch for the Morrowind mod Better Balanced Combat.

For now the auto patch just applies NPC/Creature effects but if everything on the to-do list gets finished then it could replace hand made patches.

Feel free to commit.

# To-do
Copy OpenMW load order to original Morrowind on yes/no prompt.

Convert Fortify Attack and Fortify/Drain/Restore/Damage/Absorb Weapon Skill effects to Fortify/Drain/Restore/Damage/Absorb Attribute Strength effects with magnitude divided by 10 (minimum of 1 magnitude, round up).

Convert Sanctuary effects to Fortify Skill Block.

Make blind effects only max magnitude and decrease duration by half.

Convert blind ingredient effects to Drain Block.

Apply Chantox's WRAR effects (will update with specifics once I have them).
